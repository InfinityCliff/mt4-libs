You can learn more about MetaTrader from the the MetaQuotes \r\n[website](http://www.metaquotes.net/).\r\n\r\n#Why build libraries?\r\nThe MetaQuoates Language 4 (MQL4) for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) is limited in many ways. When compared to modern\r\nprogramming languages MQL4 lacks basic language features that many you may take for granted e.g. C/C++ structs. It also\r\nsuffers poor performance when asked to perform computationally intensive tasks such as statistical calculations. The\r\nlibraries available here help address some of the short comings of the core library and are aiming to provide a work\r\naround for some of the language limitations.\r\n\r\n#Who should use these libraries?\r\nAnyone who wants to write a script, indicator, or expert advisor for MetaTrader 4. Naturally you will at least need to\r\nknow MQL4, how to install the libraries and indicators into your MT4 platform. I will be add the C++ code for some of the available functions but will make sure a DLL is available for download if you don't know C++ or how to build the DLL files.\r\n\r\n#The libraries\r\nAs of 15/10/2012 there are four libraries here:\r\n* **ninety47_stats**: is a simple library for statistical calculations - at the time of writing it currently house only 1 function to calculate the correlation.\r\n* **ninety47_common**: holds a set of functions that I would commonly use in indicators, scripts and experts.\r\n* **ninety47_string**: a set of helpful string manipulation functions.\r\n* **ninety47_test**: a set of functions to help write scripts for testing (almost unit tests).\r\n\r\nIn the future I will be adding a library of trade functions.\r\n\r\n#References\r\nHere are some useful links:\r\n* [Forex Factory](http://wwwforexfactory.com): Is a great source of trading ideas, MT4 help and general trader talk.\r\n* [Steve Hopwood's FX forum](http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/): Has lots of information and a supportive community for anyone wanting to build an indicators, experts etc.\r\n* [Visual Studio Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products): Visual Studio (even though its Microsoft product) is a great IDE and hey its the easiest way to build DLLs.\r\n* I'd put www.ninety47.com here buts its not even under construction yet :)\r\n\r\n#Feedback\r\nIf you like this code let me know by following me here and on twitter [@ninety47](https://twitter.com/ninety47).\r\n\r\n"}
